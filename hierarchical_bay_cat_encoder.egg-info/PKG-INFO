Description: 
        # Hierarichcial Bayesian Target Encoder
        `hierarchical-bay-cat-encoder` is a Python library for encoding classes of cross features derived from categorical features that relate to one another in a herarchival structure. It facilitates the process of converting categorical features into continuous variables based on the information with respect to target responses, a data preprocessing practice that often improves model performnace in machine learning and is one of well adopted winner techiniques in Kaggle competitions for tabular/structured data.
